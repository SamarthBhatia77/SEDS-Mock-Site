                <h1 className='mt-5 ml-3 text-[40px] font-mono underline'>Rocketry - Project Vayu</h1>
                <p className='mt-4 mx-4'>Project Vayu is a student-led experimental rocketry mission aimed at building and launching a low-altitude sounding rocket. The rocket is designed to carry custom-built telemetry modules to measure altitude, temperature, and acceleration during flight. It features a two-stage deployment system with a parachute for safe recovery and reusability. The project helps members gain hands-on experience with propulsion, aerodynamics, and structural design, simulating the real-world challenges of aerospace engineering.</p>
                <h1 className='mt-5 ml-3 text-[40px] font-mono underline'>CanSat Competition ‚Äì Mission Janus</h1>
                <p className='mt-4 mx-4'>Mission Janus was developed for the annual international CanSat competition, where student teams build and launch a soda-can-sized satellite that performs specific scientific missions during descent. Our payload was designed to autonomously deploy and rotate like a maple seed, transmitting live telemetry and capturing orientation data. The team successfully reached the Critical Design Review (CDR) stage in 2021 and 2022, despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This project emphasizes systems integration, electronics, and communication protocols.</p>
                <h1 className='mt-5 ml-3 text-[40px] font-mono underline'>Mars Rover Prototype ‚Äì Project Ares</h1>
                <p className='mx-4 mt-4 mb-8'>Project Ares is a Mars rover prototype engineered to navigate uneven terrain and simulate autonomous surface exploration. Equipped with a 6-wheel rocker-bogie suspension, soil collection mechanism, and wireless camera feed, the rover is capable of remote operation over varied surfaces. The project is a multidisciplinary effort combining mechanical design, embedded systems, and computer vision. It aims to provide members with exposure to real planetary exploration concepts used by agencies like NASA and ISRO.</p>
